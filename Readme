# Fractol Program: Mandelbrot and Julia Sets


## Description

Fractol is a graphical program that generates and displays fractal images. This program allows users to explore two popular types of fractals: the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set. The Mandelbrot set is a well-known fractal that arises from iterating a simple mathematical formula, and the Julia set depends on a constant parameter 'c'.

## Features

- Display both Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.
- Zoom in and out on different regions of the fractals.
- Change the constant 'c' for Julia sets to explore different variations.
- Adjust the number of iterations to control the level of detail in the fractals.
- Smooth coloring for a visually pleasing representation.

## Requirements

- C, MacOs
- MLX library for visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have make the project.
